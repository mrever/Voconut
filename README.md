# Voconut
like [Vython](https://github.com/mrever/Vython) (lets you run easily run python in vim kinda like Jupyter), but with support for [Coconut](http://coconut-lang.org/) and [Hy](https://docs.hylang.org/en/alpha/)

Should work just like [Vython](https://github.com/mrever/Vython) if Hy/Coconut are not installed.  Hy and Coconut can be installed via pip (pip install hy coconut).
